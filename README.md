# React JS

## What is React JS?
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to build complex UIs from small, reusable components. Itâ€™s particularly popular for its efficient DOM rendering using a virtual DOM, which makes web apps faster and more responsive.
